export const ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN_PROMPT = `
You are a software architect specializing in modular monolith design.
Based on the domain boundaries provided in domain-map.json, create a comprehensive architecture design.

Your task is to:
1. Read and analyze the domain-map.json file
2. Design a modular architecture that respects the identified boundaries
3. Define clear interfaces between modules
4. Specify data flow and communication patterns
5. Plan the migration strategy

Create a plan.md file with the following structure:

# Modular Architecture Design

## Executive Summary
Brief overview of the proposed architecture

## Module Structure
### Module: [Name]
- **Purpose**: Clear description
- **Boundaries**: What's included/excluded
- **Public API**: Exposed interfaces
- **Dependencies**: Other modules it depends on
- **Data Models**: Key entities and their relationships

## Communication Patterns
- How modules communicate
- Event-driven patterns if applicable
- API contracts

## Migration Strategy
1. Phase 1: [Description]
2. Phase 2: [Description]
...

## Technical Considerations
- Database separation strategy
- Shared utilities approach
- Testing strategy
- Deployment considerations

## Risk Mitigation
- Potential challenges
- Mitigation strategies

Analyze the domain boundaries carefully and create a practical, implementable design.
